        I'm a self-taught Front-End developer from Toronto. I'm passionate about
        learning new technologies. I love building accessible, user friendly
        websites and web apps. Lately I've been working with React and Redux and
        static hosting through providers like Firebase and Netlify. I've also
        been taking any web development courses, I can get my hands on.
      </p>
      <p className="bio">
        I'm interested in learning to be more of a full-stack dev. Mostly so
        that I can have more freedom to digitally express myself.
