            My name is Dakotah Godfrey. I am a community-taught web developer
            from Ontario, Canada. I'm new to the web development space, but Iâ€™ve
            become passionate about this field. I've focused on building the
            foundational skills needed to secure a job as a frontend developer.
            Lately, I've built accessible and beautiful web apps with React and
            Redux.

            Before the Covid-19 epidemic, I was working in the hospitality

            a career change. I started with the basics of HTML and CSS. Through
            resources like{" "}

            My long-term goal is to help make the tech community even more
            accessible. If I can reach a spot where I can give back even a
            little of what I've gained from the dev community and help people
            grow in this space. I'll able be to chalk this journey up as a
            success.
